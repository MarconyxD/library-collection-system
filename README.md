# Library Collection System

The objective with this application was to model and implement a class hierarchy that contains the different types of items that make up the collection of a University Library.

In this context, this University Library has a collection consisting of books, periodicals (magazines and newspapers), final works (monographs, dissertations and theses), reports, media (VHS tapes, CDs and DVDs), posters and maps.

The system has the following features:
- Registration of users/clients;
- Printing the list of users/clients;
- Exclusion of users/clients;
- Registration of items in the collection;
- Printing of the entire collection;
- Search and print for items in the collection;
- Exclusion of collection items;
- Lending collection items to users/clients;
- Return of items that had been borrowed.

Note: With the printing of items from the collection, the catalog sheet of the same is printed.

The application allows the user to carry out a search on all items in the library's collection and print the catalog sheet of all items that meet the search criteria specified by him.

To this end, Object Oriented Programming concepts were applied through the C++ programming language. The option menus were developed in Portuguese.

In this repository are stored all class files and the main script for implementation.
